'''Implement a base class Animal with a method make_sound(). Create derived classes Dog, Cat, and Cow that each override the make_sound() method to provide their respective sounds. Write a function that takes an Animal object and calls its make_sound() method, demonstrating polymorphism.'''

'''Write a Python program that defines an interface Shape with a method area(). Implement this interface in two classes Square and Triangle. Instantiate objects of both classes and call their area() methods, showing how polymorphism works with interfaces.'''

'''Create a base class Vehicle with a method start_engine(). Derive two classes Car and Bike that override the start_engine() method. Write a function that takes a list of Vehicle objects and calls their start_engine() methods, demonstrating runtime polymorphism.'''

'''Design a class hierarchy where Employee is a base class with a method calculate_salary(). Derive classes PermanentEmployee and ContractEmployee from Employee and override the calculate_salary() method in each. Write a function that takes an Employee object and calls its calculate_salary() method to demonstrate polymorphism.'''

'''Create an abstract class Appliance with an abstract method operate(). Derive classes WashingMachine and Microwave from Appliance and implement the operate() method in each. Instantiate objects of both classes and call their operate() methods to show polymorphism.'''

'''Write a Python program that defines a base class Instrument with a method play(). Create derived classes Piano, Guitar, and Drum that each override the play() method. Write a function that takes an Instrument object and calls its play() method, demonstrating polymorphism.'''

'''Define a base class Document with a method print(). Derive classes WordDocument and PDFDocument from Document and override the print() method in each. Create a list of Document objects containing instances of both derived classes and iterate through the list to call the print() method on each object, showing polymorphism.'''

'''Implement a class hierarchy where Person is the base class with a method display_info(). Create derived classes Student and Teacher that override the display_info() method. Write a function that accepts a Person object and calls its display_info() method to demonstrate polymorphism.'''

'''Create a base class Shape with a method draw(). Derive classes Circle, Square, and Rectangle from Shape and override the draw() method in each. Write a program that creates a list of Shape objects containing instances of each derived class and iterates through the list to call the draw() method on each object, demonstrating polymorphism.'''

'''Design a class hierarchy where Notification is a base class with a method send(). Derive classes EmailNotification, SMSNotification, and PushNotification from Notification and override the send() method in each. Write a function that takes a Notification object and calls its send() method to demonstrate polymorphism.'''
