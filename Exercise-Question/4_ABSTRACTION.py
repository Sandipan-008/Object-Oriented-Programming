'''Create an abstract class Vehicle with an abstract method move(). Derive two classes Car and Bicycle from Vehicle, each implementing the move() method. Instantiate objects of Car and Bicycle and call their move() methods to demonstrate abstraction.'''

'''Define an interface Payment with methods make_payment() and refund(). Implement this interface in two classes CreditCardPayment and PaypalPayment. Demonstrate how these classes provide different implementations for the interface methods.'''

'''Write a Python program to create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method area(). Derive classes Square and Triangle from Shape and implement the area() method in each. Instantiate objects of both derived classes and call their area() methods to show abstraction.'''

'''Design an abstract class Appliance with abstract methods turn_on() and turn_off(). Derive classes WashingMachine and Refrigerator from Appliance and implement the abstract methods. Demonstrate how abstraction allows different implementations of these methods.'''

'''Create an abstract class Animal with an abstract method sound(). Derive classes Dog, Cat, and Cow from Animal and implement the sound() method in each. Instantiate objects of these classes and call their sound() methods to illustrate abstraction.'''

'''Implement an interface Logger with methods log_info() and log_error(). Create classes ConsoleLogger and FileLogger that implement the Logger interface. Demonstrate how these classes provide different implementations for logging information and errors.'''

'''Write a Python program to create an abstract class Employee with abstract methods calculate_salary() and get_details(). Derive classes FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee from Employee and implement the abstract methods. Instantiate objects of both classes and demonstrate how abstraction works.'''

'''Define an abstract class Transport with an abstract method start(). Derive classes Bus and Train from Transport and implement the start() method in each. Create instances of both derived classes and call their start() methods to show abstraction.'''
